## Star Citizen - Fleet Info

This code injects a new sub page in the account section of https://robertsspaceindustries.com
On this page, all vehicles contained in packages are displayed with some info.

## Status

WIP prototype, so it's quite dirty. Expect bugs.

## How to use

There is no dedicated browser extension yet.

Best way is to use any script injection plugin for your browser and inject the
[contents of fleetInfoAsync.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophie-kuehn/sc-fleet-info/master/fleetInfoAsync.js) on "https://robertsspaceindustries.com/account" and its sub pages.
You will always have the newest version of the script.

If this method is not working for you, you also can inject the
[contents of fleetInfo.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophie-kuehn/sc-fleet-info/master/fleetInfo.js) directly.
You will need to take care of updates yourself.

I use [https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/codeinjector](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/codeinjector)
([https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector))

It's also available for Chrome.

Due to some fancy caching by CIG, i had to add a fix for the pagesize of the normal pledge list. You might want to edit the PLEDGE_LIST_PAGE_SIZE property at the top of the script.
